# Advanced DTN

## Congestion Control:

- **Rate Control -** easing load by controlling rate of traffic. (Not present in UDP)
- **Adaptive forwarding -** to direct traffic away from congestion hotspots

## **Protocols:**

1. **Spray and Focus**
    1. the spray phase is the same Spray and Wait 
    2. Because it is a spray protocol, there will be multiple copies of each message
    3. The **focus phase** uses ***single-copy utility*** bases routing scheme to forward a copy of the message further
    4. forwarding decision are **made on timers** nodes come in communication range of each other.
    5. **How it works:**
        1. node A forwards to another node B **if and only if B has a higher potential of delivering** the message to D.
2. **SimBet**
    1. uses the exchange of **‘between centrality’** and **‘similarity to the destination’** metrics for determining next hop.
    2. maintains **ONE COPY** of each message at a time.
    3. **Centrality -** source node will forward message to a more **central node** with a higher chance of finding a suitable relay node. - **a measure of the structural importance of a node in a network.**
    4.  ****A central node uses **similarity and betweenness centrality** to avoid unecessary info

## **Replication Management**

- The idea of controlling the frequency and amount that messages are replicated.
- **This is often the cause of congestion within an DTN.**

Protocols:

1. **Café**
    1. **Single-Copy** protocol which uses **adaptive forwarding technique** to direct traffic away from nodes experiencing congestion.
    2. Uses forward heuristics that are calculated from social and resource heuristics
    3. **components:**
        1. **Contant Manager**
            1. keeps stats like frequency and duration for each contact
        2. **Congestion Manager**
            1. keeps stats about the availability of each node it comes into contact with.
    4. This protocol will chose a route that is further but less congested over a path that is closer and more congested
2. **CafREP**
    1. Café using **adaptive forwarding algo with an adaptive replication management technique.**
    2. basically will use socially driven data (from other nodes) to not only decide which node to forward to **but also** how many replica is needed
3. **Autonomous Congestion Control (ACC)**
    1. **Single-copy** protocol which approaches congestion control with **modelling buffering space based on financial model, associating space on a router to the capital available to a bank.**
    2. Free buffer space is regarded aas money
    3. A node chooses to accept a message based on 
        1. message TTL 
        2. the node’s occupancy and projected growth
        3. history of transmission (record of how much buffer was used by previous messages and for how long)
4. **Density aware Spray and Wait (DASW)**
    1. **adaptive replication technique** that calculates the number of replications a message is allowed. 
    2. the dynamic number is caluclated using an abacus that is precomputed from preceding experoments such as the **RollerNet** experiment
    3. The Abacus is built by simulating a number of Spray and wait algos with varying fixed numbers for the number of copies, using the average number of nodes. 
5. **RAPIS**
    1. **Resource Allocation Protocol for Intentional DTN**
    2. four steps:
        1. Initialisation - two nodes exchange metadata detailing messages in their buffers
        2. Direct delivery - nodes deliver messages destined to the encountered node, in order of utility (??)
        3. replication - the marginal utility for each message is estimated, and messages are replicated in decreasing order of this utility;
        4. termination - the process is terminated once either the connection is broken or all messages have been delivered or replicate
    3. **Utility** is calculated on one of three metrics:
        1. Average Delay
        2. Minimising missed deadlines
        3. minimising maximum delay
6. **GeOpps (Geographical Opprtunistic Routing for Vehicular Networks)**
    1. a single -copy based protocol
    2. utilises data gathered from navigation systems in order to route packets **towards a specific geographical location**
    3. the **next hop** is selected as the vehicle that is **projected to be going in the direction of the destination**
