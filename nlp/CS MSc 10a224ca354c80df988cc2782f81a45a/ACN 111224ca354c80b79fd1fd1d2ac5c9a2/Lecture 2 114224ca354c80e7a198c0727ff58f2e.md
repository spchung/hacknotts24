**Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs)**

Structure:

- Each node in networks works as the **server, router, and clients**

Communication:

- **multi-hop approach**
    - due to the lack of centralised network

Routing:

- **Step 1: Route Discovert**
- **Step 2: Data Transmission**

**Protocals:**

- Can be categorised into **Proactive, Reactive, and Hybrid**
- **Proactive** aka “table driven routing protocol” - each node has full knowledge of the network
- **Reactive** aka “on-demand” - each node only holds info of path to destination nodes
- **Hybrid -** a bit of both
