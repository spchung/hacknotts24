- intro begins after 5.1

Classes:

### 1. **Node**

- A **Node** represents a basic computing device in ns-3, similar to a computer in a real network.
- It is an abstraction that holds applications, protocol stacks, and devices to enable communication.
- Represented by the `Node` class in C++, it forms the fundamental building block for simulations.

### 2. **Application**

- An **Application** is the user-level software that generates activity in simulations.
- Unlike real-world applications that run on system software, ns-3 applications run directly on **Nodes**.
- Represented by the `Application` class in C++, developers can create specific types of applications like `UdpEchoClientApplication` and `UdpEchoServerApplication`.

### 3. **Channel**

- A **Channel** models the communication medium connecting **Nodes**, such as Ethernet cables or wireless connections.
- In ns-3, this is represented by the `Channel` class, which manages the communication between **Nodes**.
- Channels can be specialized, for example, into `CsmaChannel` for Ethernet-like functionality or `WifiChannel` for wireless communication.

### 4. **Net Device**

- A **Net Device** represents both the hardware (like a Network Interface Card) and the software driver used to connect a **Node** to a **Channel**.
- It enables communication between nodes by being "installed" on a node and interfacing with channels.
- The `NetDevice` class can be specialized for different types of networks, such as `CsmaNetDevice` for Ethernet or `WifiNetDevice` for wireless networks.

### 5. **Topology Helpers**

- **Topology Helpers** simplify the process of connecting multiple **Nodes**, **NetDevices**, and **Channels**.
- They automate common setup tasks like assigning IP addresses, creating devices, and linking them to channels, making it easier to create complex network topologies.

This abstraction helps in modeling complex network behaviors by breaking them down into manageable components, similar to their real-world counterparts.
