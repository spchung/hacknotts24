# Order of Execution

1. **Initialization:**

The simulation starts by loading the configuration file and initializing key components of the simulation environment. This involves reading settings, initializing nodes, message generators, and event schedulers.

- **Key classes and packages:**
    - **`core.Settings`**: This class reads and stores the simulation settings from a configuration file (`.txt`), such as movement models, routing protocols, number of nodes, buffer sizes, etc.
    - **`core.SimScenario`**: This is the main class that defines the simulation scenario. It reads the configuration, sets up the nodes and their properties, and initializes various components.
    - **`core.SimEventScheduler`**: This is responsible for scheduling and handling events (message transfers, node movements, etc.) in the simulation.

**Order of execution:**

- The `SimScenario` reads the configuration and initializes nodes, routers, and movement models.
- The `SimEventScheduler` starts the simulation by adding the initial events to the event queue.

### 2. **Node and Router Setup:**

Nodes, their movement models, and routing protocols are created and initialized according to the configuration file.

- **Key classes and packages:**
    - **`core.DTNHost`**: Represents a node in the network (including its router, message buffer, and position).
    - **`routing.Router`**: This is an abstract class that defines the behavior of routing protocols. Specific routing algorithms (like `EpidemicRouter`, `SprayAndWaitRouter`, etc.) inherit from this class.
    - **`movement.MovementModel`**: This class defines how the nodes move during the simulation. Different movement models (like `RandomWaypointMovement`, `MapBasedMovement`) are defined in the `movement` package.

**Order of execution:**

- The `SimScenario` class creates instances of `DTNHost` for each node, attaching the appropriate movement model and routing protocol.
- Nodes are then placed at their starting positions according to the movement model.

### 3. **Simulation Clock and Event Queue:**

After the environment is set up, the simulation clock (`SimClock`) and event queue (`EventQueue`) take over the execution. Events like message generation, node movement, and message forwarding are scheduled.

- **Key classes and packages:**
    - **`core.SimClock`**: Keeps track of the simulation time. It advances the time as events are processed.
    - **`core.EventQueue`**: Manages all scheduled events. Events are processed in the order they are scheduled, and new events are added dynamically as the simulation progresses.
    - **`core.SimEventScheduler`**: Coordinates with the event queue to execute events at the appropriate times.

**Order of execution:**

- The `SimClock` advances the time as each event in the `EventQueue` is processed.
- The `SimEventScheduler` adds and removes events from the `EventQueue` based on interactions (message transfers, node movement, etc.).

### 4. **Message Generation and Transfer:**

Messages are generated and exchanged between nodes based on the configured generation settings and routing protocols.

- **Key classes and packages:**
    - **`core.Message`**: Represents a message being transferred between nodes.
    - **`routing.Router` subclasses**: Specific routers (like `EpidemicRouter`, `SprayAndWaitRouter`, etc.) implement the logic for how messages are routed between nodes.
    - **`routing.ActiveRouter`**: A base class for routers that handles common functionality such as message forwarding and buffer management.

**Order of execution:**

- Messages are generated according to the configuration (e.g., random message generation, message size, etc.).
- The `Router` class (or its subclasses) decides which messages to forward to neighboring nodes based on the routing protocol in use.
- Nodes transfer messages to each other based on proximity, availability of buffer space, and the routing strategy.

### 5. **Node Movement:**

As the simulation progresses, nodes move according to their movement models. Movement triggers message exchanges when nodes come into contact.

- **Key classes and packages:**
    - **`movement.MovementModel` subclasses**: Defines how nodes move in the simulation. Each node can have a different movement model (e.g., random movement, map-based movement).
    - **`movement.MapBasedMovement`**: For nodes moving along paths on a map.

**Order of execution:**

- Nodes move based on their movement models (as defined in `MovementModel` or its subclasses).
- As nodes move closer to each other, the event queue adds connection events, triggering potential message exchanges.

### 6. **Termination:**

The simulation runs until the specified end time is reached or all events in the `EventQueue` are processed. Results are gathered from the simulation.

- **Key classes and packages:**
    - **`core.Reporter`**: Gathers statistics from the simulation, such as message delivery rates, delays, and other performance metrics.
    - **`core.SimScenario`**: Manages the end of the simulation and collects the final results.

**Order of execution:**

- The simulation terminates when either the `SimClock` reaches the end time or there are no more events in the queue.
- Statistics are collected, and results are written to output files for analysis.

### High-Level Sequence of Execution:

1. **Initialization** (`Settings`, `SimScenario`, `SimEventScheduler`)
2. **Node and Router Setup** (`DTNHost`, `Router`, `MovementModel`)
3. **Clock and Event Queue Start** (`SimClock`, `EventQueue`)
4. **Message Generation and Transfer** (`Message`, `Router`, `ActiveRouter`)
5. **Node Movement** (`MovementModel`, `MapBasedMovement`)
6. **Simulation End and Result Collection** (`SimScenario`, `Reporter`)
