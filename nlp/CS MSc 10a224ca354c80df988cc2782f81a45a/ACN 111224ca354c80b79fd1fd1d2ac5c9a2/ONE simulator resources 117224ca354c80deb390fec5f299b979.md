Code:

1. is it sufficient to just change the router file if I want to implement a new protocol
2. so the map can always stay the same and we can just change the movement params to simulate different situations (in city, in water, or cars).
3. what are the metrics we should look at
    1. congestion rate
    2. delivery rate
    3. resource consumption
