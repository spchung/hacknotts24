# VANETs

V2V network that can be used for Intellignet Transport System (ITS)

VANETs have limited degree of freedom their mobility patterns 

- because of roads and parking lots and shit

Why:

- For cars to communicate information in a timely manner

Tiers of Information:

1. **Safety Application**
    1. accident, condition of road
2. **Convenience Apps**
    1. Congestion info or parking information
3. **Pleasure Apps**
    1. whatever else is left, what ppl are doing in the cars

**Manets vs Vanets:**

|  | M | V |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scale | Small | Large |
| Predictive Mobility | Large | Small |
| High Mobility | Small | Large (car fast) |
| Partitioned Network | Less often | Often |

The **high speed** of VANET nodes reduces transmission capacity. This also means that the network **Topology** also changes rapidly.

**Low or High Congestion** may also affect protocol performance

# Standard - IEEE 802.11p

Wireless Access for Wehicular Environment (WAVE) 

Communication: **hop by hop**

Area of coverage: **300m - 800m (per hop)**

- Communication beyond this range is impossible and message will noe be transferred.

**Handle Congestion:**

- IEEE 802.11p implements the **store-carry-forward paradigm.**
- When a node is in congestion (many other nodes around), the protocol will only allow it to forward message once it has moved to a less congested area.

## **VDTN (Vehicular Delay Tolerant Network)**

enables comms in spite of issues:

- long, variable delays
- spare connectivity
- high error rates; latency;
- where end-to-end connections are unknown

Made possible when each node becomes **a custodian of the message.**

by **Only Forwarding A Message When An Opportunity Arises.** 

## Categories

1. Pure Cellular
    1. Vanets that rely on 4G or 5G networks

** Side Note: 5G, unlike its predecessors are made to be used in Ad Hoc mode (peer to peer). 

1. Pure Ad-hoc
    1. not reliant on any fixed infrastructure
2. Hybrid - duh 

## **Types of Safety Messages**

- Beacon safety Messages
    - **periodic messages** about the vehicleâ€™s speed, direction etc
- Event-driven Safety messages
    - Sent **when imminent danger is detected.**
    - Sent with the highest priority
