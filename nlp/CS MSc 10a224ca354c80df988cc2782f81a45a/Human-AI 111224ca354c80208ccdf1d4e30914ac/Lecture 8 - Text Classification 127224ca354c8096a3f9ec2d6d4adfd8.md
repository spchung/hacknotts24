# Lecture 8 - Text Classification

With vector representation of word space we can do some plotting and apply some machine learning approaches.

A simple 2D array we can visualise and apply ML

- Regression
- k nearest neighbour
- decision trees

### Classification is Generalisation

- Samples models train on determine the model’s accuracy on new data
    - a model trained using student performance in Taiwan is not going to work on a dataset of American students

### Sample is only a fraction of the full picture

- unless you can train a model on all data in the world, machine learning models will always have biases

### **Methods**

- Logistic Regression
    - anything above 0.5 is 1 else 0
