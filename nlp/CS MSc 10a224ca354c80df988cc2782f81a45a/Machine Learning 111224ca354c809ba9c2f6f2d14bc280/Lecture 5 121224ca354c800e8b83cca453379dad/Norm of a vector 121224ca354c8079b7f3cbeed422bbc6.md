# Norm of a vector

In linear algebra, the notation ||w|| represents the **norm of vector w**

- **The norm is a measure of the "length" or "magnitude" of the vector**

Most commonly used one is the **Euclidean norm**, also known as the **L2 Norm** or simply the **2-norm**.

In machine learning and optimisation, norms are used to regularise models (e.g., L1 and L2 regularisation) and to compute distances between points (e.g., Euclidean distance).
