# Lecture 7 - Artificial Neural Networks

**Supervised Nonlinear Model**

**Questions: [TESTED]**

- in multi-class classification ANN, how do we label our data
- how to perform partial derivatives of sigmoid function
- hyperparams?
    - how many layer
    - how many node per payer
    - learning rate for Loss Function
- intrinsic parameters:
    - W weight and constant B
- Difference between decision tree and ANN:
    - decision tree can be easily visualised
    - ANN can be extended to a larger dataset than Decision tree
